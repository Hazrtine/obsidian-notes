<span class="sub-header">Conspiracy Theories:</span>
<div class="separation-box">
<span class="sub-sub-header" style="	font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;"> What is a Conspiracy Theory? </span>
<p>Involve some type of conspiracy where powerful individuals or entities like government orgs, etc. commit or intend to commit a harmful act. </p>
<p> They begin with an actual event/occurrence, then build hypothetical situations to explain how this situation could have happened.</p>
<hr>
<span class="sub-sub-header" style="	font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;"> How do they come around? </span>
<p>Conspiracy theories tend to come from people that are vulnerable to such propaganda, usually in politically extreme ideologies/environments (like Ultra-conservative parts of the US.) </p>
<p> A missing of personal outlook needs and desires.</p>
<p>A disconnect between the complexity/severity/significance of the event/situation and the explanation offered making them seek a better explanation.</p>
<p> EXAMPLE: </p>
<p>Some guy on a street corner in Fourth Ward gets shot and dies, people will not very much care because that makes sense. However, if that happens to someone famous, then the explanation is EXPECTED to be more complex because of the significance of the death of the person itself.</p>
<hr>
<span class="sub-sub-header" style="	font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;"> Why do they persevere? </span>
<p>It is an adrenaline rush; it feels almost like a personal and selective club of people.</p>
<p>A selective group of people that are the real thinkers/intellectuals that REALLY know what is happening.</p>
<p>A hero complex; something like "I **NEED** to tell the people before they are taken advantage of! I am their only hope! Something like the rebels from Star Wars.</p>
<hr>
<span class="sub-sub-header" style="	font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;"> Why are there more now than earlier? </span>
<p>Mostly because of social media and the internet mostly. Makes sense.</p>
<p>When quality of life is good, then conspiracy theories tend to decrease; when the economy crashes or war is coming, then conspiracies tend to increase.</p>
